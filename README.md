# Lumbridge - Android Financial App

Lumbridge is a simple financial app built for Android using and learning Jetpack Compose. It was created as a passion project to help manage day-to-day tasks and is open-source just for the love of the game. If you're interested, feel free to use it, improve it, or fork it!

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Lumbridge is more than just a financial utility app — it's a playground for me to learn and experiment with **Jetpack Compose** and modern Android development. The app includes several financial tools that I personally find useful, but it's entirely open to contributions, feature requests, and improvements!
